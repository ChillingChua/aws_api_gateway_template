# requirements for the post_call lambda function
# for reference: they have to be installed in the subdir for the lambda deployment
# use:
#   pip install <package> -t /<path>/<to>/post_call
#
# this is handled in ansible deployment, and for local dev work, they can just
# be installed into a normal virtual environment
